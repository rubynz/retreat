        <h2>Do I have to be a Ruby developer?</h2>
        <p>
          Absolutely not! While this retreat is run by Rubyists, it is for the
          whole developer community and there is something here for everyone!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="left">
        <h2>What is a Ruby Retreat?</h2>
        <p>
          Ruby Retreat is an unconference run by and for the whole programming
          community!
        </p>

        <p>
          Picture yourself in the mountains with your smartest friends. The air
          is clear and so is your mind. There's no limit to what you can achieve
          here.
        </p>

        <p>
          • Scheming? Certainly.<br />
          • Coding? It's likely.<br />
          • Enlightenment? Maybe.<br />
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="left">
        <h2>What do I do at Ruby Retreat?</h2>
        <p>
          It's a low-structure unconference; activities are driven by the
          community. Some suggestions:<br />
          • Work on projects.<br />
          • Share your work with others.<br />
          • Talk through gnarly problems with thoughtful, friendly folks.<br />
          • Connect with the developer community.<br />
          • Follow your dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this retreat, we have also organised some talks and workshops
          in advance. More details will be added soon, including a way to
          schedule a talk or workshop if you're keen to give one too.
        </p>

        <h2>Is there financial assistance available?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Yes!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a student, or are currently unwaged, we have a discounted ticket price
          available. Just select "Student / Unwaged" when booking a ticket
          <a href="https://ruby-retreat-nz-2020.lilregie.com/booking/attendees/new">at Lil Regie</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have an opportunity scholarship ticket thanks to Ruby New Zealand.
          This ticket is available to anyone who self-identifies as belonging to a group that is poorly
          represented in tech. No explanation will be required if you choose this ticket – we just want to see you there!
        </p>
        <p>
          If this applies to you, then to secure your ticket for the low price of $60, simply choose
          "Opportunity Scholarship" when booking a ticket (when sles open).

        <h2>What's the accessibility like?</h2>
        <p>
          This Ruby Retreat is held near the summit of a mountain, at a ski
          lodge, in an alpine environment. Due to the layout of the
          accommodation lodge and day lodge, including some stairs, the venue is
          not well suited for people with mobility issues, and is unfortunately
          not wheelchair accessible.
        </p>

        <h2>When should I arrive to and leave from Christchurch Airport?</h2>
        <p>
          Please try to arrive before 2PM on Friday, 27th October. Transport for the retreat is provided from,
          and back to, Christchurch Airport.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barring any unforeseen circumstances out of our control, it's safe to
          book flights to leave after 1PM on Monday, 30th October.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are <strong>more than welcome</strong> to arrive early and leave late! There is a
          lot of beauty in the Canterbury region, and Te Wai Pounamu (South Island),
          which is very much worth seeing.

        <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
        <p>
          Some bedding. There are mattresses and pillows and 1 blanket per bunk
          but no sheets, duvets etc so you will need to bring these, or sleeping
          bags along with pillow cases. Please also bring a towel. You should always
          bring a towel.
