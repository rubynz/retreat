            <dt>What is a Ruby Retreat?</dt>
            <dd>
              Ruby Retreat is an unconference run by and for the Ruby programming language community.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Picture yourself in the mountains with your smartest friends.
              The air is clear and so is your mind.
              There's no limit to what you can achieve here.
              <ul>
                <li>Scheming? Certainly.</li>
                <li>Coding? It's likely.</li>
                <li>Enlightenment? Maybe.</li>
                <li>Drinking? *Not* alcohol. <strong>Ruby Retreat is alcohol free.</strong></li>
              </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>What do I do at a Ruby Retreat?</dt>
            <dd>
              This will be the very first Ruby Retreat, although it is the sequel to <a href="https://camp.ruby.nz">Rails Camp</a>.
              It's a low-structure unconference; activities are driven by the community.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Some suggestions:
              <ul>
                <li>Work on Ruby projects.</li>
                <li>Share your work with others.</li>
                <li>Talk through gnarly problems with thoughtful, friendly folks.</li>
                <li>Connect with the Ruby community.</li>
                <li>Follow your dreams.</li>
              </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Should I come to Ruby Retreat?</dt>
            <dd>
              Yes. <a href="https://ruby-retreat-nz-2020.lilregie.com/">Buy a ticket here.</a>
            </dd>
            <dt>When should I arrive to, and leave from, Christchurch Airport?</dt>
            <dd>
              <dd>Please arrive before 3PM on Friday, 27th March. You are more than welcome to arrive early!</dd>
              <dd>There is a lot of beauty in the Canterbury region, and it's worth seeing.</dd>
              <dd>Barring any unforeseen circumstances out of our control, it's safe to book flights to leave after 12PM on Monday, 30th March.</dd>
              <dd>Again, it'd be even better to extend your trip and see the region, or even the entire South Island.</dd>
            </dd>
            <dt>What do I need to bring?</dt>
            <dd>Some bedding. There are mattresses and pillows and 1 blanket per bunk but no sheets, duvets etc so <strong>you will need to bring these, or sleeping bags along with pillow cases</strong>.</dd>
            <dt>Can we sponsor Ruby Retreat?</dt>
            <dd>
              <dd>We'd love to have your support. </dd>
              <dd>Get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:retreat@ruby.nz">retreat@ruby.nz</a> and we'll send through more details.</dd>
