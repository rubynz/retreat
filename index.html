            <dt>What is a Ruby Retreat?</dt>
            <dd>
              Ruby Retreat is an unconference run by and for the Ruby programming language community.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Picture yourself in the mountains with your smartest friends.
              The air is clear and so is your mind.
              There's no limit to what you can achieve here.
              <ul>
                <li>Scheming? Certainly.</li>
                <li>Coding? It's likely.</li>
                <li>Enlightenment? Maybe.</li>
                <li>Drinking? Not alcohol. <strong>Ruby Retreat is alcohol free.</strong></li>
              </ul>

            <dd>
              This will be the very first Ruby Retreat, although it is the sequel to <a href="https://camp.ruby.nz">Rails Camp</a>.
              It's a low-structure unconference; activities are driven by the community.
            </dd>
            <dd>

                <li>Share your work with others.</li>
                <li>Talk through gnarly problems with thoughtful, friendly folks.</li>
